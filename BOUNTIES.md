Kinto

Open page →
About
Kinto is an L2 focused on providing safe access to on-chain finance. It's built on top of the Ethereum network using the Arbitrum Nitro Stack, and it's non-custodial, transparent, permissionless, and governed by the community.
Kinto is fully EVM-compatible but Kinto has two idiosyncratic differences that you need to understand. The first one is that Kinto has User-Owned KYC, meaning every user needs to be verified before sending any transaction. The second one is that Kinto has native Account Abstraction, meaning that users are forced to have a smart wallet instead of plain EOAs and users do not have to worry about or pay gas.
Benefits of Building on Kinto include:
- Free KYC, KYT and AML. You get all this compliance tooling out of the box.
- Sybil resistance.
- Better UI/UX through Account Abstractions.
- Higher level of security through Hypernative and Ironblocks.
- Insurance Policy to all Kinto users.
- Mining rewards for developers based on the usage and TVL of their applications.
Learn more in our Docs and Development Guide.

As an example, you could selectively share your location or a trip itinerary as encrypted attestations that will only be viewable by friends and family.
Qualification Requirements
- You must use schemas, attestations, and Sign Protocol's indexing service.
- Sign Protocol must be part of your project's core logic/functionality.
- Project submission must have a working live demo link.
- Attestations must store encrypted (usable) data and/or aid in your project's encryption/decryption process.
- Using protocols that aid in encryption/decryption, such as Lit Protocol, is recommended and preferred.

About
Flow is a layer one blockchain with a powerful smart contract language (Cadence) and full EVM equivalence (any Solidity, smart contract, or protocol that works on Ethereum or an EVM L2 works on Flow). The network was designed from the ground up to enable consumer crypto applications that scale to mainstream audiences and seamlessly connect to digital ecosystems. It is based on a unique, multi-role architecture, and designed to scale without sharding, allowing for massive improvements in speed and throughput while preserving a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment.

Flow has been architected with a clear vision for the future of consumer crypto, and meticulously designed to address the shortcomings of earlier blockchains to ensure scalability, usability, and efficiency are not simply an afterthought. By incorporating critical protocol-level primitives, such as account abstraction and on-chain randomness, as well a powerful transaction model and scalability without sharding, Flow sets itself apart as a blockchain made for those interested in building apps for widespread adoption and developer-friendly innovation. With over 45-million consumer accounts connected to experiences from the NBA, NFL, and Disney, the next killer app is being built on Flow.

Killer apps have the power to create and lead entire industries by addressing a pain point at the perfect moment. As an L1 blockchain designed for mass adoption and consumer-grade products, Flow believes the next breakthrough will emerge in the form of a Consumer App.

Consumer Apps are consumer products that solve real-world problems by placing the end-user at the heart of the experience. Unlike traditional DeFi or “x-to-earn” products that can feel distant to the average consumer, Flow seeks applications that are accessible, intuitive, and valuable to millions (or billions!). Think ChatGPT for artificial intelligence (AI), and how it made AI approachable and useful for hundreds of millions, enabling even non-experts to create custom AI tools.

🌐 Orbit, BoLD, Timeboost ⸺ $2,000

Up to 2 teams will receive $1,000
The Orbit, BoLD, Timeboost Prize invites developers to push the boundaries of Arbitrum’s newest technologies: Orbit, BoLD (Bounded Liquidity Delay), and Timeboost. This prize is for projects that creatively showcase these advanced, infrastructure-focused tools and/or applications that leverage these novel technologies or augment them in some way (e.g. minimizing trust, etc)
Using Orbit, developers can achieve unmatched scalability and customizability for their own chain; BoLD unlocks permissionless validation & paves the path for decentralized validation (and the economic structures that could be built on top); and Timeboost offers a new way for chains to handle MEV at the protocol layer. Whether you're building DeFi, gaming, social, or cross-chain interoperability projects, this is an opportunity to leverage Arbitrum’s cutting-edge stack in ways not done before.
Example ideas include:
- New in-protocol or app-specific ways for AMM pools to retain MEV with Timeboost
- Applications requiring Orbit’s customizability, like blazing fast 100ms block times, rapid ~1-minute withdrawals with AnyTrust, 3rd party DAs (e.g. Avail, Celestia, EigenDA), high throughput (10M Gas/s), or increased contract size limits.
- Cross-chain interoperability solutions that use Arbitrum Orbit for novel L3-to-L3 interactions
- New tooling with BoLD for decentralized validation, such as staking designs, auto-pooling of funds to secure a chain, or fraud-proofing WASM in other use cases
Qualification Requirements
- Must utilise or augment BoLD, Orbit, or Timeboost
- Can be an app or tooling

About
Uniswap needs no introduction and its upcoming version, Uniswap v4, reignites the protocol as a premier platform for developers. Uniswap v4 introduces Hooks, allowing developers to plug arbitrary solidity logic inside the swap lifecycle. Whether it’s pool creation, swaps, or liquidity modifications, developers can elect to execute solidity logic before and after an operation has happened.
Beyond hooks, v4 also introduces dynamic fees, flash accounting, ERC-6909 balances, and a singleton design — all to enable gas-efficient complex operations.
From token-based fee discounts to MEV minimization, v4 provides an wide opportunity for researchers and developers — regardless of skillset.
With Unichain providing 250ms transaction times, expect to observe better transaction quality for Uniswap v4!

🏆 Build an Opinionated DEX ⸺ $2,000

The design space for decentralized exchanges is vast and often underexplored. We challenge you to rethink the Decentralized Exchange accounting for the future of onchain economies. Valid solutions include: novel approaches to mitigating MEV; building an application specific sequencing layer by leveraging technologies like AVS, TEEs (SUAVE), and pre confirmations; Cross chain shared liquidity technologies like the Valantis Sovereign Vault and interop token standards.
The goal is to rethink one of crypto’s most fundamental primitives with strong recognition of the changes occurring in Ethereum’s Order flow market and the advent of new offchain technologies.
Fully onchain solutions such as building novel AMM invariants, specialized dynamic fee structures, or single-chain shared liquidity / flash accounting vaults are also valid. We encourage solutions that leverage modular architectures, such as those offered by frameworks like Valantis, to facilitate rapid prototyping and deployment of novel DEX concepts.
Valantis offers full control over key components of AMM design including bonding curves, liquidity provisioning, fee incentives, and data verification for seamless integration with off-chain systems.
Qualification Requirements
- Smart contract implementation of an opinionated dex design
- Use of Valantis modular stack
- Frequent commits on GitHub
- Documentation explaining your approach and its benefits

🫖 🏴‍☠️ Introducing Dstack - A Flashbots X Project 🏴‍☠️ 🫖
_
⚡️🚨 Warning: Building on Dstack may cause an intense love for TEEs 🚨⚡️
_
Phala is a Core Contributor to Flashbots' X Project, Dstack, and we are offering a glimpse into the future of the Web3 development stack. Dstack provides developers the freedom to build beyond the limits of today's Web3 development. With the Dstack SDK, devs can make remote attestations and key derivations in the TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) from their own docker apps written in ANY language they prefer to build in. All developers need to do is build a docker image of the project, and the project is ready to be deployed on a TEE Server. For local development, we offer a docker TEE Simulator so you can test your products locally before launching in a real TEE Server.
_
⁉️ WTF is TEE ⁉️
TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is a cool CPU feature that makes your code Verifiable and Privacy-Preserving by locking it in a black box. Trusted hardware ensures even the OS or hardware can't mess with your code. For example, when you put a Web2 app in a TEE, you get Web3 out!
_
❓How is it Verifiable❓
The verifiable hardware produces Remote Attestation, which proves the exact code is running in a genuine TEE with integrity and privacy guarantees.
Get the RA quote from your app and verify it on the TEE Attestation Explorer at https://dstack-sim-explorer.vercel.app

Bonus Bounty - Ledger Nano X for top prize or top 10 finish! 🚀

About
We are on a mission to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3. We are building a new category - verifiable data infrastructure. Our all-in-one infrastructure layer allows Solidity developers to extract, verify and integrate real-world data into Ethereum smart contracts, in the form of trustless claims. By integrating Web2 data i.e. Web Proofs and Email Proofs, into Web3 apps, we support a decentralised, secure, and efficient internet. Our technology is powered by state-of-the-art Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and optimised to provide the best developer experience on EVM-compatible blockchains.
Our four Solidity features (i.e. vlayer superpowers):
- Time Travel - Leverage history of on-chain data in your contracts.
- Teleport - Compute cross-chain data from EVMs.
- Web Proofs (also known as zkTLS) - Bring private Web2 data on-chain.
- Email Proofs (also known as ZK Email) - Tap into the trusted contents of emails.
Benefits of building with vlayer:
- You can use Solidity and existing tooling, such as Foundry
- No needs to learn new DSLs or programming languages
- Access key data sources directly from your Solidity smart contract on any EVM-compatible blockchain

🧠 Most Creative Use Case (AI Agents, Privacy, etc.) ⸺ $3,000

Up to 2 teams will receive $1,500
Most people understand ENS' simple use cases (name → address lookup, address → name lookup, etc.), but few explore what else it can be used for. For inspiration, consider naming AI agents or auto-rotating addresses on each name resolution for privacy applications.
Qualification Requirements
It should be obvious how ENS improves your product and is not just implemented as an afterthought. Your demo must be functional and not just include hard-coded values. Upon submission, your project showcase must have a video recording or link to a live demo (ideally both).
▼
🏅 Best use of ENS ⸺ $4,000

Any type of ENS integration is eligible for this prize. Get creative!
An example of a successful project may be a smart contract wallet that mints an ENS subname on L2 and sets its primary name upon deployment. If you're building an AI project, consider how ENS can be used to name autonomous agents. Come by our booth for help brainstorming ways to integrate ENS into your project!

CoW DAO
$10,000

About
CoW DAO is on a mission to make DeFi safe and seamless for all. It does this by developing user-protective products like CoW Swap (the most-traded DEX frontend, by volume – recently surpassing both Uniswap and 1inch), CoW Protocol (the #1 intents-based exchange protocol, with the most robust solver competition in DeFi), MEV Blocker (the leading MEV-protecting RPC endpoint), and CoW AMM (the first MEV-capturing AMM).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CoW Protocol works by separating trade intents from trade executions – giving users the ability to express any DeFi-related intent imaginable, while delegating trade execution to sophisticated matching engines called solvers. Ultimately, this results in better prices for users, while protecting them from bad outcomes like MEV exploitation. In addition to hosting the largest solver competition in DeFi, CoW Protocol has the most-advanced developer framework of any DEX. Programmatic Orders let developers deploy orders that execute perpetually into the future based on arbitrary conditional logic, and CoW Hooks let developers chain swaps together with any other DeFi action (ie: simplifying advanced DeFi actions). The sky is the limit!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CoW AMM is the first MEV-capturing AMM. Only CoW Protocol solvers are allowed to trade against CoW AMMs, meaning that – since solvers win auctions by offering users more surplus – CoW AMM pools grow by capturing value for LPs that would normally go to arbitrage bots. Because liquidity pools auto-rebalance and protect LPs from LVR, they behave like enhanced index funds that (according to portfolio theory) reduce risk and increase return for tokenholders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submissions will be judged on creativity and utility. We will only accept working prototypes.
Prizes

🥈
2nd place
$1,500
Programmatic Orders let developers deploy orders that execute perpetually into the future based on arbitrary conditional logic. Winners of this hackathon prize will develop advanced conditional order types with CoW Protocol’s programmatic order framework that are able to be leveraged by any DeFi user or that enable unique abilities within a broader technical architecture.
Example submissions might include:
- Trailing stop loss orders
- VWAP orders
- Bracket orders
- Funky conditionals (i.e. only buy when it rains in Dubai)
- Order types with cross-relevance to another part of DeFi (for example, automated collateral swaps might be relevant to lending protocols)
- Auto-swapping between LP tokens based on pool state
- Exotic order types that leverage CoW AMM LP tokens
Qualification Requirements
- Prizes will be awarded to the most innovative and unique use of Programatic Orders
- Github repo with viewable code
- An included README describing how to install and use the code
- Code should be easily executed by our judges

🥇
1st place
$2,500
🥈
2nd place
$1,500
CoW Hooks are pre- and post- interactions that allow users to bundle multiple DeFi actions together with their trades, leading to significant UX improvements. Winners of this hackathon prize will develop interesting hooks that can be leveraged by any DeFi users or that enable unique abilities within a broader technical architecture.
Example submissions might include:
- Claim rewards → sell rewards → re-deposit to yield vault
- Claim airdrop → swap to USDC or ETH
- Unlock LP tokens → swap token to USDC → bridge & send to address (payments)
- Borrow stables → swap → deposit in farming vault
- Deposit wstETH to Aave, borrow USDC → swap USDC for USDT → deposit USDT to Morpho
- Flashloan ETH, deposit ETH and borrow DAI → swap DAI for ETH → repay flashloan
- Open CDP → borrow stables → swap → bridge/deposit in farming vault
- Unstake → swap → bridge
- Approve token → swap token → bridge
- Borrow stables → swap stables → deposit in farming vault
- Rebalance funds with a trade → deposit on CoW AMM
Note: CoW Swap will soon launch a “Hooks Store” within its UI where users will be able to take advantage of hooked DeFi interactions with ease – we are keen to build our Hooks library and may be interested in collaborating on CoW Hooks beyond the scope of this hackathon.
Qualification Requirements
- Prizes will be awarded to the most innovative and unique use of CoW Hooks
- Github repo with viewable code
- An included README describing how to install and use the code
- Code should be easily executed by our judges
- Each submission should be capable of creating a working order on testnet or Mainnet (Ethereum, Arbitrum or Gnosis Chain)

🔗 Control Accounts on Any EVM through NEAR ⸺ $4,000

Up to 2 teams will receive $2,000
With the release of Chain Signatures, NEAR accounts can now easily control EVM accounts by simply making a contract call on NEAR. This enables to bring all NEAR benefits (low costs, fast finality, email login, built-in account abstraction) to any EVM, while also simplifying to build cross-chain products.
Use NEAR accounts to control EVM accounts, and help bring a better UX to any existing project, or solve a common problem for EVM users. Explore the simplest chain abstraction tool, and allow users to do everything from a single account so they don’t have to worry about which chain they are on!
Ideas:
+ Cross-chain drops: build a dApp that allows users get assets on an EVM chain through NEAR linkdrops
+ Multichain DAO: build an dApp that allows users to vote on NEAR, but executes the actions on one or multiple EVM
+ dYdX-based products: Leverage Chain Signatures to manage dYdX positions and build products on top of the dYdX platform
Developer Tooling: Improve the developer experience by building or enhancing tooling around Chain Signatures (e.g. by adding more EVM RPC endpoints)
Qualification Requirements
+ You are free to incorporate any ECDSA-based blockchain(s) of your choice (Bitcoin, Cosmos chains, L1s/L2s EVM, etc.) but must include at least one network that settles on Ethereum (e.g. ETH, Optimism, Arbritrum).
+ Your submission must NOT be a simple fork of an existing example/project with minimal changes.
+ Your submission should include a basic readme file explaining the scope of the project.
Judging Criteria:
+ Creativity and originality of the idea.
+ Quality and completeness of the product.
+ Code readability and documentation.
+ BONUS: Feedback on the chain signatures technology and developer experience to help improve it

About
Brevis is a smart ZK coprocessor that empowers smart contracts to read the full historical on-chain data from any chain and run customizable computations in a completely trust-free way.
Brevis can trustlessly read the states, transactions, and receipts of any time frame. It efficiently runs computations on data of any size: as the data to be proved increases in size, Brevis significantly reduces the per-unit cost and time for proof generation. Additionally, Brevis seamlessly verifies ZK proofs on any blockchain, providing a unified and trustless user experience for dApps. Brevis empowers data-rich use cases, including data-driven DeFi, user-segment optimized live-ops features, zkBridges, zkDID, and smart-contract native risk control, all executed in a trustless manner across multiple chains.

4th place
$1,000 ×2
> Brevis allows smart contracts to trustlessly read historical on-chain states/tx/events and run customizable computations on top at low cost, enabling data-driven dApp UX. No ZK knowledge is required. We look forward to amazing projects and teams that can become our long-term ecosystem partners and candidates for our developer ecosystems grants and programs.
Qualification Requirements
- Developers are required to integrate Brevis SDK into their dApps successfully.
- The dApps should access historical blockchain states, transaction and/or events, and run customized business logic/computation on those data through Brevis ZK Coprocessor.
- The integration should be meaningful: accessing historical states that are also available in the current blockchain states does not count as successful integration.
- To qualify for the first prize, the dApp must write customized and meaningful computation logic on the data accessed. Simply utilizing historical on-chain data without any computation does not qualify for the first prize.
- We do consider partial or incomplete integration on a case-by-case basis. For submissions aiming to solve real-world use cases with a clear path towards full integration, we will most likely issue the full amount of the bounty.
-If there are not five top projects, we might only give out some of the prizes listed above, or we may adjust prize amounts. If no project is good enough to win, we'll explain why.

🪝 Best use of Webhooks ⸺ $1,000

How do you know when something happened on the blockchain? When you lend your magic missile NFT to a friend in your web3 game, how do you know when it’s been returned? By constantly pressing refresh like a cave person? Of course not! You use MultiBaas’s Webhooks feature! Now your application can respond to actions as they happen.
This prize is for the best use of the webhooks feature. Some examples:
- Send an email when your DeFi order goes through
- Update your NFT dashboard when a new listing happens
- Send notifications to the other signers when a new multisig transaction needs confirming
Handling events smoothly can make all the difference in a good user experience or an efficient, scalable implementation. We look forward to seeing what you do with webhooks.
Qualification Requirements
Your application should demonstrate a useful action taken in response to the receipt of a webhook callback from MultiBaas.
Judging is based on the applicability of the use case and the technical execution.
▼
🏃‍♀️ Speedrun Time Attack ⸺ $1,000

Think you’re fast? How quickly can you get the blockchain part of your hackathon development up and running?
Record a video of how quickly you can configure MultiBaas and perform a blockchain interaction with your application.
Please record from the MultiBaas dashboard page i.e. https://[your-url].multibaas.com/, NOT from console.curvegrid.com.
You can use any of the features in MultiBaas to demonstrate the functionality, but you must clean the relevant configuration before recording. For example, if you use the MultiBaas API to call a function on a smart contract you uploaded, the video must start without the contract in MultiBaas and include the upload.
The video must show the code used to call the API and the result of the successful call in your application or testing environment in a way that it’s clear that it’s working properly.
Qualification Requirements
The Speedrun Time Attack prize will be awarded to the video that best demonstrates speedy development using MultiBaas. Judging is based not just on the length of the video but also the quality, feature(s) shown, plausibility (don’t fake it), and clarity (it should be easy to understand what’s happening).
By submitting for this prize you agree to let us use the video for promotional or other purposes.

About
Arx HaLo chips are mini hardware signers -- and they're embedded in every ETHGlobal wristband!
Using libHaLo you can generate transactions, EIP-191 and EIP-712 signatures easily. You can generate signatures direct from a browser via a tap. That means that you can do things like (1) use the chip as a wallet, (2) generate attestations (3) use the chip to generate entropy.
ERS (the "Ethereum Reality Service" ) is a protocol that resolves chips to content. See docs below on how to enroll chips (find someone from Arx Research if you would like a chip that is not enrolled as all ETHGlobal wristbands direct to ETHGlobal content).

About
Kinode is a software platform that augments existing blockchains with a permissionless, peer-to-peer cloud. By embedding primitives like networking, identity, data persistence and blockchain I/O into the OS, Kinode makes it simple for developers to get feature-rich decentralized applications up and running, in contrast to existing solutions which inevitably sacrifice on either security or feature-parity with Web2. Kinode supports applications written in any language that compiles to Wasm, allowing developers to work with their preferred tools.
Prizes

🏆 Best KinodeOS Integration ⸺ $1,000

The project should harness the full potential of the Kinode platform in an innovative way, creating an application that leverages its built-in primitives such as peer-to-peer messaging, decentralized architecture, and Web3 integration.
Projects can fit into any genre: For example Social, Games, DeFi or Productivity. They can be clones of existing projects, whether web2 or web3, as long as they use the KinodeOS in some way. Ideas should be possible to get a minimum-viable version running in a day, but have potential for further development to fully-featured product.
Some ideas for inspiration:
- Create a competitive game that awards crypto assets to winners
- Use zkTLS / “web proofs” to generate a simple prediction market for some
TLS-certified events (NFL game results, weather, box office stats)
- Token-gated bulletin boards / forums
- Discord / Telegram / Twitter client or bot with unique feature(s)
Whether you are a solo developer or part of a team, this prize seeks to recognize creativity, technical excellence, and the potential for future development.
Qualification Requirements
- Platform Integration: The submission must utilize Kinode’s capabilities, particularly peer-to-peer messaging or decentralized application architecture.
- Novelty & Innovation: The project should demonstrate a unique or innovative approach to an existing challenge, or explore a new idea within Social, Games, DeFi, Productivity, or Infrastructure.
- Technical Execution: The app must showcase a minimum viable product (MVP) with a working backend in Rust and a frontend in HTML/CSS/JS.
- Impact Potential: Submissions should have the potential to scale or evolve into fully-fledged applications after the hackathon.
- Compliance with Kinode’s Guidelines: Participants must follow Kinode’s development guidelines and best practices to ensure compatibility with the platform.
